## Pillars
Wondering about the pillars? In traditional IT, the three pillars are defined/considered as: 

- Technology: everyting used related to software, hardware including scripting and automation.  
- People: the skilled person who can use the technology.
- Process: the well-defined workflow based on a framework like ITIL to perform incident, change, and problem management. 

While within the context of DevOps practices/methodologies, these pillars would be defined as such:

- Technology: think as platform - a set of elements that will be used to support a business critical applications including development.
- Process: not anymore linked to a closed-minded framework but embracing the Agile, continuous and iterative practices.
- People: the collaborative, transparent and open ways of working, often rename as *Culture* to avoid any confusion.

If we consider the DevOps practices, we can draw a mobius loop representing an infinite game versus a A-to-Z workflow.
