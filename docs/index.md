# DevSecOps - Ops to Hero in half a day

## Intro

Security is often an afterthought. Something that’s done at the end of the development life cycle by the security and IT operations teams. When software updates are made once or maybe twice a year, this process is manageable. But when software developers start opting for shorter, agile software development life cycles that take a few days or even a few hours, this approach to security becomes a hindrance to launching necessary updates or even launching the application quickly to production.

DevSecOps with Red Hat® solutions is not only about helping organizations with their application pipeline in a containerized environment. It’s also about helping them build, deploy, and run applications using DevSecOps practices in both traditional and containerized environments to tackle security issues and vulnerabilities early in the application and infrastructure life cycle.

In this learning session we will provide an immersive experience for attendees to understand the differences between a siloed operating model versus a collaborative one through a practical application of the DevSecOps culture.
